## Workflow

The workflow of the UniRoomies application is divided into several key steps. Here's how the user navigates through the app:

![workflow](images/ProjectwaireDigram.png)
### 1. **Login and Signup**

- **User Authentication**: The first step for any user is to log in or sign up using **Firebase Authentication**. Users can sign up with their email, Google, or other available authentication methods.

    - **Sign Up**: New users need to create an account by providing their details, including email and password. The app then verifies the user and grants access.
    - **Login**: Returning users can log in using their credentials and are redirected to the onboarding process if it's their first time logging in.

### 2. **Onboarding Process**

Once logged in, users go through an onboarding process to set up their preferences:

- **Add User Details**: Users are asked to provide details about themselves, including:
    - Preferred gender of roommate
    - Lifestyle preferences (quiet, social, etc.)
    - Budget and preferred location
    - Whether they have pets, are okay with smoking, etc.

- **Add Flat Details**: Users can also add details about their flat, including:
    - Rent, size, available amenities 
    - Photos of the flat
    - Contact information and available dates

After the onboarding is completed, users are ready to start using the appâ€™s full features.

### 3. **Home Page - Flat Search**

The home page is where users can begin their search for potential roommates and flats. On this page:

- **Search Flats**: Users can search for flats based on specific preferences like rent, location, number of rooms, etc. The app displays all matching results in a list.

- **Flat Details View**: Each listing shows basic information about the flat, and users can tap on a flat to view more details. These include:
    - Photos of the flat
    - Rent, location, and amenities
    - Contact information for the landlord or tenant

### 4. **Detailed View and Map Integration**

- **Map View**: When users tap on a flat listing for more details, they are redirected to a **map view** where they can see the flat's exact location on a Google Map. The map is integrated directly into the app, showing nearby amenities such as markets, public transport, etc.

- **Navigation**: The map provides easy navigation, allowing users to explore the surrounding area before making a decision.

### 5. **Mark as Favorite**

- **Add to Favorites**: Users can mark flats they like as **favorites** by clicking a heart icon. This saves the flat to their personal list of favorite flats for easy access later.

- **View All Favorites**: Users can access all their saved favorite flats on a separate fragment, making it easier to compare options.

### 6. **Messaging Feature**

- **Chat with Other Users**: Users can send and receive messages from other registered users of the app. The **real-time messaging** feature is powered by **Firebase Firestore**, ensuring seamless communication.

- **Group or One-on-One Messaging**: Users can chat with potential roommates, ask questions, and discuss further details about flats or preferences.

### 7. **Profile Section**

- **User Profile**: The profile section allows users to manage their personal details, preferences, and flat listings. Users can:
    - Update their personal information
    - View their own listed flats and edit them
    - See their saved favorites and clear them

- **Flat Management**: Users can also manage the flats theyâ€™ve added, update the details, or delete them from the platform.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies are used to build the **UniRoomies** app:

### 1. **Kotlin**
Kotlin is the primary programming language used for developing Android applications. It provides a modern, concise syntax with built-in features like null safety, which makes development faster and more reliable.

- **Why use it**: Kotlin simplifies the Android development process with less boilerplate code and increased readability, which enhances development efficiency and app maintainability.

### 2. **XML**
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is used for defining the UI layout in Android. It allows the design of user interfaces by specifying elements like buttons, text fields, and images in a structured format.

- **Why use it**: XML allows for easy and clean separation between UI design and business logic, making the app more maintainable and scalable.

### 3. **MVVM Architecture (Model-View-ViewModel)**
MVVM is a design pattern that separates the application logic into three layers:
- **Model**: Handles data and business logic.
- **View**: The UI components (Activities, Fragments).
- **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data and interacts with the Model, providing data to the View.

- **Why use it**: MVVM improves code maintainability by separating concerns between UI and data management. It also helps with unit testing by making the code more modular.

### 4. **ViewModel**
ViewModel holds and manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. It ensures that the data survives configuration changes, such as screen rotations, without needing to reload it.

- **Why use it**: ViewModel helps keep the UI logic separate from the business logic, allowing for cleaner, more testable code.

### 5. **Room Database**
Room is a persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, making database operations easier. It is used to store user data, favorite flats, and preferences locally on the device.

- **Why use it**: Room simplifies database access and provides better performance and type safety compared to using raw SQLite directly. It also integrates well with LiveData and Kotlin Coroutines.

### 6. **Kotlin Coroutines**
Kotlin Coroutines are used to handle asynchronous tasks in a simpler way than traditional threading methods. Coroutines enable efficient background operations without blocking the UI thread, making the app more responsive.

- **Why use it**: Coroutines help handle tasks like network requests, database queries, and file operations in the background, improving app performance and user experience by avoiding UI thread blocking.

### 7. **Firebase**
Firebase provides a suite of cloud-based tools to help with authentication, real-time databases, and hosting.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Handles user authentication via email/password or social logins (e.g., Google).
- **Firebase Firestore / Realtime Database**: Used to store and sync data in real-time, such as user profiles, flat details, and messages.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: Allows push notifications to be sent to users about new messages or updates.

- **Why use it**: Firebase reduces the complexity of backend infrastructure, offering a fully managed platform for authentication, real-time data sync, and cloud functions. It's a great choice for mobile app developers who want a backend solution without managing servers.

### 8. **Material Design UI (Material UI)**
Material Design is a design system that provides guidelines for building visually appealing, consistent, and user-friendly interfaces. Material UI components like buttons, cards, and floating action buttons (FAB) are used to create a polished and modern app UI.

- **Why use it**: Material Design components are intuitive and provide a seamless user experience, making your app look and feel modern and polished. They also ensure consistency with other Android apps.

### 9. **View Binding**
View Binding is a feature that allows you to more easily interact with your UI components by binding them directly to the layout in your code, avoiding the need for `findViewById`.

- **Why use it**: View Binding simplifies working with UI components by eliminating the risk of null pointer exceptions and reducing boilerplate code. It improves code readability and maintainability.
